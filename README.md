To setup vcpkg, install it via the Visual Studio installer. To enable/disable it run these commands from the Developer PowerShell:
```
vcpkg integrate install
vcpkg integrate remove
```

To add additional dependencies run:
```
vcpkg add port [dependency name]
```

To update the version of a dependency modify the overrides section of vcpkg.json.

```
vcpkg new --application
```
